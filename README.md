# Microsoft Graph API for SharePoint Online

This repository contains my personal collection of Microsoft Graph API request examples focused on SharePoint Online.

## Features

- Authentication using client credentials flow
- File and Document Set management (create, upload, move, delete)
- Site and list provisioning and lifecycle management
- Sharing and permissions management
- Compliance label handling
- SharePoint page creation, publishing, and web part management

## Usage

I have included the Postman collection JSON file (`GraphAPI.postman_collection.json`) in this repository. You can import this file into Postman or the Bruno app to explore and test the API endpoints as collections.

## Documentation

Detailed API endpoint descriptions and request examples are available in the included HTML documentation (`Docs/GraphAPI - SharePoint-documentation.html`).

## Contributing

This is a personal collection, but suggestions and improvements are welcome via issues or pull requests.
